In middle and high school I maintained my own website with some amateurish Javascript and PHP, lovingly crafted in my IDE of choice: Notepad.\r
\r
In my early 20s I enjoyed some extremely marginal success as a musician, playing to nearly empty venues all across the eastern half of the US, and eventually pressing a few hundred vinyl records, more than half of which did not end up in a dumpster.\r
\r
Since about 2014, I remembered that I really really like messing around with code and learned Python so I could pretend to be working on a video game.\r
\r
In 2017 I completed a code bootcamp at a non-profit in Augusta, GA called The Clubhouse, which is legitimately a very cool place doing great things for the tech and entrepeneur community in the CSRA. They helped me learn modern full stack web development and I never looked back.\r
\r
Throughout the calendar year 2022 I was employed by a company in Augusta as a full stack engineer, and learned how to do some pretty involved things with SQL, as well as how to dabble in Docker, AWS, Wordpress, Jira, Excel and Zoom, although my most enduring legacy will always be the internal wiki page on how to set up the dev environment.`,ne=`This site was created with SveleteKit and the Skeleton UI library, which is based on Tailwind.\r
